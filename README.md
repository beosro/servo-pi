servo-pi
========

Work on creating a web interface to control servos from the Raspberry Pi

This project uses the ServoBlaster project from here:
https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits/tree/master/ServoBlaster

End result of this will be a web interface allowing the control of a pan-tilt mechanism for the Raspberry Pi Camera Module.
